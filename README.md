# Optimal Fashion

*Most optimal armor for your favorite build looks like poop? Find the next best thing!*

This is basically Dark Souls III armor finder at [soulsplanner.com](soulsplanner.com) with some additional functionality.

## Differences from soulsplanner.com
* Allows you to specify a whitelist for items you want to have.
* Allows you to specify a blacklist for items you want to exclude.
* Does **not** find armor sets that are very similar (whitelist and blacklist should mostly cover this).
* Is optimized a bit better (especially when specifying min limits for multiple params, which prolly nobody uses)
* Is not a website and ofc is still WIP.

## Features
* Eh, I'll think what to add when this is more complete.

## Thirdparty tools used
* [soulsplanner.com](soulsplanner.com)'s armor section for armor parameter tables.
* [Table Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-capture/iebpjdmgckacbodjpijphcplhebcmeop) Chrome extension to parse said tables.
* [fast-cpp-csv-parser](https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser) to parse CSV files.
